|   1    | XS           | **Insignificant**, one line chenge or get resource        | Obiusly, **zero** unknowns                                   | **Simplistic**, I could do many of these in a day.           |
|   2    | S            | **Minor** change, configuration updates, or write a GET resource | Know, **little to zero** unknowns                            | Pretty **easy**, sanity check level core review              |
|   3    | M            | **Small**, scoped feature; requires **insignificant** research or cross-team coordination | Generally know; **few** unknowns                             | Will have to focus, requires meaningful **codre review and test**, needs **one** session of concentration. |
|   5    | L            | **Complex** feature, requires **little ** research or cross-team coordination | Have an idea, **research limited ** to know unknowns         | Complexity or amount of work to be done requiresa **couple** session of concentration |
|   8    | XL           | **Large **,complex feature;  requires some research or corss-team coordination | Concept and the goals **understood** ; solution requieres some research that can only be done as part of the work | Complexity or amount of work to be done requires a **few** sessions of concentration |
|   13   | XXL          | **Very large**, complex feature requires **significant** research or corss-team coordination | Concept and the goals **understood**; Solution requires **significant research** that can only be done as part of the work | Complexity or amount of work to be done requires a **many** sessions of concentration |

| Baseline | Zero additional testing effort beyond standard practice      |
| +1 Step  | Testing effort exceeds standard practice and is equal to the effort of the implementation. |
